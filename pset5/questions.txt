0.  an artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust.
1.  in a nutshell it seems like the function measure the usage of resource and returns it in a struct form.
2.  16 members
3.  I will say it is pass by reference in order to optimize the amount of memory used in the stack
4.  is actually quite simple, "fgetc" is a function tha reads the next character in a file, so the first for loop iterates reading each letter until the "End Of File" is reach. 
    in the first condition "int c" must be alphabetical or \ with index more than 0 so it will append a character to word, if index is more than 45 letter it discard the word.
    else if it discard words with digits
    else if index is greater than 0 we found the end of the word and is time to do de magic.
        first append a \0 at the end of the word, count of word increment, meassure usage of resource beford and after misspeled function, check time, index back to zero.
    start again 
5.  it will be imposible to discard words that contains digits
6.  becouse two members of struct rusage (ru_utime, ru_stime) are of type struct timeval wich are const values.
7.  I used a trie, that handels 27 nodes for the alphabet and the apostrofie and a bool to know if is a word.
8.  Very slow, like 0.30 is total time.
9.  I change the way the function load creates a new node by creating my own function called getNode
10. yes, particalrly in the load function where I have to iterate over the length of simillar words to be able to place new nodes at the end of the trie
